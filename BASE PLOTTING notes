# BASE PLOTTING NOTES

plot() # the general function for plotting objects (points, lines, etc.)

# plot arguments

# setting axes
plot(x = data$var1, y = data$var2)
plot(var2 ~ var1, data)

# reference for base R graphics: https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~joseff/rstudy/week4.html
# types of plots
argument: plot = ""
p: points (this is the default)
l: a line
b: "both", points connected by line segments
c: just the connecting segments of "b"
o: "overplotted", points and lines overplotted
s: stair
S: alternative stairs
n: none

# types of points
argument: pch = "" (1:14 are outlines; 15:25 are filled (use bg="color" argument for different colors))

# types of lines
argument: lty = "1:6"

boxplot(var1 ~ factor) # boxplots; split data ~ factor/grouping variable

hist() # histograms

lines() # add on lines on top of plot


###===Saving plots
pdf("Plots//plot1.pdf", width =, height = )
# this saves the plot pdf in another folder

###===Customization arguments

with(data, plot(x = var1, y = var2)) # overplots another dataset
# attaches and detaches for a single expression

# assigning labels
xlab = "X axis", ylab = "Y axis"

# setting axes limits
xlim=c(0,300), ylim=c(0,1500)
# setting similar axes fits for multiple figures
xlim <- c(0, 1.1*max("data on X axis"))
ylim <- c(0, 1.1*max("data on Y axis"))

# setting axis scaling
yaxp=c(0,1500,3) # y limit is 0 to 1500 by 3 intervals
xaxp=c(0,300,3) # x limit is 0 to 300 by 3 intervals

# remove space around 0
xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i"

# using colors in plots
col="color" # default color
col.axis # tick mark labels
col.lab # x-label and y-label
col.main # title of plot

#remove colored border around plot
argument: bty = "n"

# adding points
?points

# setting graphical parameters
?par

###===Legends
legend(
  x="topright/bottomleft/etc", # sets location
  legend=data[,1], # sets names of data points in legend
  pt.bg = 1.5,
  pch = 19,
  bty = "o"/"n" # box around plot?

###===Plotting multiple figures
# create a matrix of plots:
par(mfrow=c(nrow, ncol)) # specifies the columns and rows
# this must be called before the call to plot

# adjusting margins around each plot
par(mar = c(bottom, left, top, right))
# Default is par(mar = c(5,4,4,2) + 0.1)

# changing margins around the entire matrix
par(oma = c(bottom, left, top, right))

# deleting axes
add xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n" arguments in each individual plot

# adding text to plots
mtext(text = "", side = , # 1=bottom, 2=left, 3=top, =4right
      line = # how close to the plot?
      outer = T/F # TRUE: use outer margins in multiple plot matrices. centers a label under all plots
  # this comes after the individual plot call

layout() # creation of multiple figure regions of unequal sizes
create a matrix on paper on how you want to arrange plots/figures
matrix(c(), nrow, nocol, byrow=T)
