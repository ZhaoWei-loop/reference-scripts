Brief summary:
   - finished HW1

Description:
   - edited the "CL.theorem" function to run a loop to create random samples and histograms
   - created a dataframe to house the sample size changes
   - figured out how to use apply() to run the custom "CL.theorem" function; only passed the dataframe and specified other arguments
